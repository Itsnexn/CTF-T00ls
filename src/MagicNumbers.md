# Magic Numbers
this is a copy and paste from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)
-   [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format "Graphics Interchange Format") image files have the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code for "GIF89a" (`47` `49` `46` `38` `39` `61`) or "GIF87a" (`47` `49` `46` `38` `37` `61`)
-   [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG "JPEG") image files begin with `FF` `D8` and end with `FF` `D9`. JPEG/[JFIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFIF "JFIF") files contain the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code for "JFIF" (`4A` `46` `49` `46`) as a null terminated string. JPEG/[Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif "Exif") files contain the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code for "Exif" (`45` `78` `69` `66`) also as a null terminated string, followed by more [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_(computing) "Metadata (computing)") about the file.
-   [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics "Portable Network Graphics") image files begin with an 8-[byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte") signature which identifies the file as a PNG file and allows detection of common file transfer problems: `\211` `P` `N` `G` `\r` `\n` `\032` `\n` (`89` `50` `4E` `47` `0D` `0A` `1A` `0A`). That signature contains various [newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline "Newline") characters to permit detecting unwarranted automated newline conversions, such as transferring the file using [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "File Transfer Protocol") with the _ASCII_ [transfer mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#Protocol_overview "File Transfer Protocol") instead of the _binary_ mode.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#cite_note-9)
-   Standard [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI "MIDI") audio files have the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code for "MThd" (**M**IDI **T**rack **h**ea**d**er, `4D` `54` `68` `64`) followed by more metadata.
-   [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) or [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") scripts may start with a ["shebang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) "Shebang (Unix)") (#!, `23` `21`) followed by the path to an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_directive "Interpreter directive"), if the interpreter is likely to be different from the one from which the script was invoked.

-   [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript "PostScript") files and programs start with "%!" (`25` `21`).
-   [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF "PDF") files start with "%PDF" (hex `25` `50` `44` `46`).
-   [DOS MZ executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable "Typo") files and the [EXE stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXE#Other "EXE") of the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") [PE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable "Portable Executable") (Portable Executable) files start with the characters "MZ" (`4D` `5A`), the initials of the designer of the file format, [Mark Zbikowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zbikowski "Mark Zbikowski"). The definition allows the uncommon "ZM" (`5A` `4D`) as well for dosZMXP, a non-PE EXE.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#cite_note-doszmxp-10)
-   The [Berkeley Fast File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Fast_File_System "Berkeley Fast File System") superblock format is identified as either `19` `54` `01` `19` or `01` `19` `54` depending on version; both represent the birthday of the author, [Marshall Kirk McKusick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Kirk_McKusick "Marshall Kirk McKusick").
-   The [Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record "Master Boot Record") of bootable storage devices on almost all [IA-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32 "IA-32") [IBM PC compatibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible "IBM PC compatible") has a code of `55` `AA` as its last two bytes.
-   Executables for the [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy") and [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") handheld video game systems have a 48-byte or 156-byte magic number, respectively, at a fixed spot in the header. This magic number encodes a bitmap of the [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo") logo.
-   [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga "Amiga") software executable [Hunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Hunk "Amiga Hunk") files running on Amiga classic [68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68000 "68000") machines all started with the hexadecimal number $000003f3, nicknamed the "Magic Cookie."
-   In the Amiga, the only absolute address in the system is hex $0000 0004 (memory location 4), which contains the start location called SysBase, a pointer to exec.library, the so-called [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computing) "Kernel (computing)") of Amiga.
-   [PEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Executable_Format "Preferred Executable Format") files, used by the [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS "Classic Mac OS") and [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS "BeOS") for [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC "PowerPC") executables, contain the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code for "Joy!" (`4A` `6F` `79` `21`) as a prefix.
-   [TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF "TIFF") files begin with either `II` or `MM` followed by [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything "Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything") as a two-byte integer in little or big [endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") byte ordering. `II` is for Intel, which uses [little endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") byte ordering, so the magic number is `49` `49` `2A` `00`. `MM` is for Motorola, which uses [big endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") byte ordering, so the magic number is `4D` `4D` `00` `2A`.
-   [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") text files encoded in [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 "UTF-16") often start with the [Byte Order Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark "Byte Order Mark") to detect [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") (`FE` `FF` for big endian and `FF` `FE` for little endian). And on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") text files often start with the UTF-8 encoding of the same character, `EF` `BB` `BF`.
-   [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM "LLVM") Bitcode files start with `BC` (0x42, 0x43)
-   [WAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD "Doom WAD") files start with `IWAD` or `PWAD` (for _[Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game) "Doom (1993 video game)")_), `WAD2` (for _[Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game) "Quake (video game)")_) and `WAD3` (for _[Half-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game) "Half-Life (video game)")_).
-   Microsoft [Compound File Binary Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format "Compound File Binary Format") (mostly known as one of the older formats of [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office "Microsoft Office") documents) files start with `D0` `CF` `11` `E0`, which is visually suggestive of the word "DOCFILE0".
-   Headers in [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format) "ZIP (file format)") files begin with "PK" (`50` `4B`), the initials of [Phil Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Katz "Phil Katz"), author of [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS") compression utility [PKZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP "PKZIP").
-   Headers in [7z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z "7z") files begin with "7z" (full magic number: `37` `7A` `BC` `AF` `27` `1C`).
